								<h1>Welcome!</h1>
								<p>Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet. Over the past centuries, many have tried to find concepts unique to humans: art, society, morality, language, etc. At the same time, we've found that many of the things we have held to be uniquely human are present, in some form or another, across the animal kingdom. Language, however, with all of the trappings of grammar, syntax, pragmatics, semantics, and so on, has shown itself time and time again to be the hallmark of humanity. Birds engage in art and creativity; eusocial animals organise themselves in complex hierarchical societies; studies have suggested the existence of some sort of morality in certain animals—but only humans can use language. And it's been language what has allowed humanity to radically transform the world around us, for better or for worse.</p>
								<p>Language has fascinated me for almost my entire life, and I've spent a lot of time studying languages both to learn specific ones and to study about languages in general. Eventually this fascination introduced me to conlanging—the process of creating fictional languages (conlangs). Most of my conlanging work involves <i>a posteriori</i> conlangs, which I define to be conlangs that are derived from natural languages through diachronic sound and grammatical changes. I enjoy researching a historical stage of a language and deriving from it a daughter language through realistic, plausible changes according to established linguistic principles. These projects are usually accompanied by a bit of ethnographic worldbuilding too. I strive to make realistic fictional peoples and languages that feel like they could exist in real life, yet also allow me to insert some creative flair.</p>
								<p>This website serves as a place to store and showcase these projects.</p>

								<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
								<p>I am currently working on four projects with various degrees of completeness. While I am showing all of them here, not all them are currently developed enough to be presented online.</p>

												<p>Darvaz Tokhar (<i>yacə tuxaṣṣa</i>) is a fictional Tocharian language spoken in the Badakhshan region of modern-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan. During the first millennium C.E., the Tocharian city-states of the Tarim Basin flourished thanks to their connection to the Silk Road connecting the Old World. A series of invasions by Tang China, the Tibetan Empire, and Turkic peoples put an unsurmountable strain on the Tocharians leading to their eventual absorption and assimilation into the Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho. Most of what we know of the historical Tocharians comes from archeological digs in the Tarim as well as a small corpus of texts written in Tocharian A and B. Tocharian A texts are mostly liturgical in character, consisting of translations of Buddhist texts, while Tocharian B texts include more secular topics such as medicine and love poetry. Scattered mentions of Tocharians exist in Chinese records depicting them as shrewd merchants.</p>
												<p>This conlanging project seeks to model the evolution of the Tocharian languages had they survived past antiquity and developed in a Central Asian context. It includes an ethnological project of the fictional Tokhars, isolated descendants of the Tarim Tocharians, consisting of a survey of their cultural practices, religious history, and political history.</p>

												<p>Bretonese (<i>bredoñeg</i>) is a fictional Celtic language, descended from the southwestern varieties of Common Brythonic. Before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, the island of Great Britain was populated by Celtic-speaking Brythonic peoples and the Picts (their exact relationship with other ethnic groups is disputed). Starting in the 3rd century and ending in the 5th, various crises befalling the ailing Roman Empire and Great Britain would trigger multiple waves of migrations of Britons to continental Europe. They settled two main areas: the Armorican peninsula in modern-day Brittany and the northwestern corner of Iberia. The Bretons' Brythonic identity and culture has survived to the present day, although their language is now critically endangered. The Brythonic Celts of Iberia, however, saw their identity subsumed very early on and almost entirely forgotten by history. Their very existence is only indirectly hinted at by surviving church documents, onomastic evidence, and archaeological digs.</p>
												<p>Through this project, I want to reconstruct how this nearly-forgotten Brythonic people would have evolved in an Iberian environment had they not been assimilated. Given their presence in northern Galicia, the language is influenced greatly by Galician, Asturian, and later Castilian. In universe, it survives to the present albeit in a vulnerable state.</p>
